TODO for 2.0
============

  - Horde_Mail_Rfc822_Address

      Store hostnames IDN decoded in object.
      Store personal data MIME unencoded in object.
      Rework idn option to writeAddress().
      Remove adl.
      Remove personal_decoded (same as personal).

  - Horde_Mail_Rfc822_List

      Use this object to store a list of addresses instead of an array.
      Allows us to:

        - Add methods like counting the number of addresses and groups.
        - Deprecate the 'nest_groups' parameter to parseAddressList(), since
          the internal Iterator can be configured to skip groups.
        - Add unique() method that would filter duplicate addresses.
        - Add filtering mechanism to limit results.

  - Horde_Mail_Rfc822_Group

      Store groupname data MIME unencoded in object.
      Remove groupname_decoded (same as groupname).
